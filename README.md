<h3>AppleCart api & admin panel</h3>

<p>This is my pet-project server-side part, based on Yii2 framework. All the request handlers are implemented in /api directory. It has some principles  violations (e.g. DRY), I'll fix it soon :) </p>

<p>The /backend dicrectory contain admin entry point with controllers and pages.</p>

<p>All the models are in /common directory</p>

<p>Frontend part is made as an SPA and ca be found in this repo: git@github.com:ebrhde/applecart-frontend.git <br> You can place it in special directory in the project root</p>
